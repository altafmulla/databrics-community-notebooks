In this tutorial we will explore large datasets for NSE Data
Download the kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/abhishekyana/nse-listed-1384-companies-data/version/2
Explode the zip and sort by size. delete css less than 5 kb. These are mostly erroneous files or tickers which are no longer valid.
Assuming databricks cli is installed,(Read Readme for details)
From command prompt or terminal
cd nse-listed-1384-companies-data
dbfs cp -r ./HISTORICAL_DATA  dbfs:/FileStore/tables/nse_full

The command will recursively upload all files from your local to the above location. 
Will take some time to upload. If you get connection timeouts rerun command, it will skip already uploaded files.
After all files are uploaded, follow multiplecsvmerge.ipnyb instructions
which will create the merge css under /dbfs/FileStore/tables/allnsedata/nsecombinedall.csv


under your account click, Data> Add Data>Create New Table> DBFS (Tab)>
navigate in Select a file from DBFS pane to  and select file : FileStore/tables/allnsedata/nsecombinedall.csv
click Create table with UI option, attach to the running cluster
preview table
Table name:nsecombinedall
click options
First row is header
Infer schema
verify data types and column names in preview pane and click Create Table.

Recommend to complete "Apache Spark on Databricks for Data Scientists" tutorial by Databricks first.
import the note book in workspace
https://docs.databricks.com/_static/notebooks/databricks-for-data-scientists.html
and run through the steps.

Next:
import the scala ScalaPythonFinancewithPlotlyBokeh.scala file and run some transformations.
Note this is just a superficial exploration and also demonstrates conversion of scale datasets to python.
Needs more transformations for true scala usage.
